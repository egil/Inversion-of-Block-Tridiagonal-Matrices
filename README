Bachelor project: We aim to understand the algorithm for block tridiagonal matrix inversion, and evaluate the theoretic performance gain by parallelizing the calculation, as presented in (Skelboe, S. (2009)). The Scheduling of a Parallel Tiled Matrix Inversion Algorithm), by implementing a prototype of the algorithm.
